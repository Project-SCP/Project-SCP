## Containment Breach

A new spin of a classic experience, You are an instance of Benjamin Oliver Walker, an ex-senior researcher at the Foundation who had their memories wiped and demoted to Disposable Class designation D-9314. After being escorted to Euclid-classified SCP-173's containment chamber to do some tests on it with another pair of D-classes, a power outage caused by SCP-079 ultimately leads to a huge containment breach among the facility. Fitted with nothing but an orange prisoner jumpsuit, You are forced to navigate your way through the site with many inhumanly dangerous anomalies hunting you down.

Upon escaping the facility via whatever mean, you are somehow recaptured by MTF personel and taken to a new facility. During a debriefing deep within said facility, an accident occurs causing yet another Mass containment breach, but in the midst of said disaster, the officials watching you didn't get the door closed far enough, allowing you to escape.

After being recaptured once espacing the facility again, yet another Containment breach happens. Upon surviving and being recatured, the 05 council has decided to designate Bejamin Oliver Walker as an SCP, known to cause mass containment breaches in any facility they are contained within.

According to reports among interdimensionally connected foundation instances. Benjamin Oliver Walker does not exibit any anomalous properties whist holding the position of a senior researcher, but in all cases where they were demoted to disposable class personel, a containment breach was recorded in any facility they were contained in.

Due to multi dimensional realities Benjamin Oliver Walker can be anyone so we can facilitate character customization. Once the organization designates you as an SCP you now can rise in classification as you escape facilities, facilitating prestige and leveling systems for Containment Breach as a Multiplayer cabable mode.

Containment breach will have seed based random generation with a progression system in how the level is built, or designed levels that people can make.
