## **🚨 What is Project SCP?**

**Project SCP** is an **idea** for an open-source, Unreal Engine-powered reimagining of **SCP: Containment Breach**, designed not just as a game — but as a *platform*. The long-term goal is to create a modern, high-performance foundation where:

* 🔁 **Classic SCP game modes** like Containment Breach can be recreated with fidelity and flair
* 🧩 **Community-created content** like new SCPs, rooms, and endings can be added seamlessly
* 🌐 **Workshop integration** would allow sharing, downloading, and possibly monetizing mods
* 💡 **Developers and modders** could build entire SCP games using the platform

This is envisioned not as a simple remake — but as the **GMod of SCP**, built for extensibility, creativity, and community growth.

---

## **💡 Why Make *Project SCP*?**

Project SCP began as a casual brainstorm while I was playing *SCP: Containment Breach Ultimate Edition Reborn* — a game I love, but one that’s showing its age. Between outdated visuals, performance hitches, and some terrifying legacy source code, I found myself wishing it could be ported to a modern engine.

With **SCP: Unity** canceled before version 1.0, and numerous SCP games scattered across different engines in varying states of completion, I had a thought:

> "What if SCP\:CB was just a *mode* in a larger, GMod-like platform where people could easily add new content, maps, and stories — and keep the universe alive through community creativity?"

That thought inspired **Project SCP** — a conceptual open-source Unreal Engine platform that *could someday*:

* Launch with a **Containment Breach base mode**: core rooms, events, procedural generation, SCP-173, and multiple endings
* Enable modders to add:

  * 🧪 SCPs
  * 🗺️ Rooms
  * 🔁 Events
  * 🎯 Endings
  * 🎮 Entire new game modes
* Use modern systems (UE5, Nanite, Lumen, modular packaging) for future-proof performance
* Offer community-driven structure for **pull requests**, **Workshop content**, and potentially **monetizable DLCs**

This is a vision for a community platform where SCP games and stories — past, present, and future — can all live under one roof.

### **🌍 Why Should You Contribute?**

**Project SCP** is not yet real — it’s a dream that needs collaborators. Here’s why you might want to help build it:

* 🎮 **Longevity**: Mods keep games alive. This could be the SCP community’s home base for the next decade.
* 🛠️ **Collaboration**: Writers, developers, artists, and designers can all contribute and be credited.
* 💡 **Flexibility**: Build one SCP, a whole new mode, or a full game — all within the same structure.
* 🧱 **Modular Framework**: Skip boilerplate. Just make content and plug it in.
* 💰 **Monetization Friendly**: Open to DLC or paid mod support — so creators can be rewarded.
* 📜 **Preserve the Legacy**: Help make sure the spirit of Containment Breach, SCP: Unity, and other classics lives on.

## **🧱 Key Feature Goals**

*These are planned goals and not yet implemented.*

### 🎮 Core Game Modes

* Containment Breach-style progression
* Multiple endings, narrative branching, SCP interactions
* Modular gameplay systems for blinking, stamina, inventory

### 🗺️ Modular Map System

* Rooms built as individual blueprints
* Procedural or manually authored maps
* Metadata-driven (e.g. "requires keycard level 3")

### 👁️ Modern Rendering

* Built in **Unreal Engine 5**
* Lumen, Nanite, modern post-processing
* Performance scaling for high and low-end PCs

### 🔌 Modding First

* Mods distributed as `.pak` files
* Types:

  * 📦 SCPs (logic + models + behavior)
  * 🏗️ Rooms
  * 🧠 Game modes
  * 🎬 Cutscenes / audio logs
* Blueprint/C++ friendly

### 🛠️ Developer Tools (Planned)

* In-editor content tools
* Sample content packs
* Hooks/APIs for AI, triggers, doors, audio

### 🧵 Steam Workshop Support *(Planned)*

* Auto-download mods, rate them, share them
* Support for full-game conversions
* Optional monetized mod support

## **💡 Why Build This?**

SCP: Containment Breach, built in Blitz3D, was groundbreaking — but technologically limited. Rather than patching legacy tech, **Project SCP** aims to reimagine the concept in a community-driven, modern environment.

We envision a future where:

* Developers can build their own SCP games faster
* Modders can contribute without deep C++ experience
* Players can find SCP horror, sandbox, and narrative games in one place

---

## **🌍 Vision Statement**

Project SCP is not just a game — it's the *platform* for SCP creators.

> Think *Garry’s Mod meets SCP Foundation*, powered by Unreal.

Our hope is to eventually support reimaginations of titles like *SCP: Unity*, *SCP: Secret Laboratory*, and more — unified in a single, extensible platform.

## **🚧 Current Status**

> 💬 We are currently in the **design and architecture phase**.

This repository contains ideas, goals, and architecture plans. We are looking for contributors to help shape the early stages:

* Suggest features
* Share mockups or modular prototypes
* Begin experiments with systems (UI, SCP AI, Inventory, Rooms)

---

## **🤝 Contributing**

We are just getting started, but we’re planning this to be a **Pull Request-friendly** and **open collaboration** project.

### 📁 Coming Soon:

* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
* `docs/` with technical breakdowns and proposals

### 🧪 Early Ideas for Contribution:

* Room spawning / layout logic
* Basic SCP behavior (173, 106, 049)
* Inventory/interaction systems
* Save/load architecture
* Mod packaging and content pipeline
